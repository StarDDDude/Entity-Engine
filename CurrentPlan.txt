1.0 Add Graphics                    [Partly Completed]
1.1 Add Transformations             [Finished, though messy, MUST move draw function]
-> Transormations can't be easily detected as sch and are hardly edite-able
-> Initial position of first block moves transfrmation (Why?)
1.2 Add shader Loading system

2.0 Add actual functionality                [Partly Completed, System for handling objects and behaviour exists]
2.1 Clean up functionality
-> Collisions and Border detection are handeled seperately
2.2 Fix functionality
-> Blocks start aiming directlyonto he walls
-> many collisions at once seem to create this effect


3 Clean up code
