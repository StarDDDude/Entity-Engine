1.0 Add Graphics                    [Partly Completed]
1.1 Add Transformations             [Finished, though messy, MUST move draw function]
-> Transormations can't be easily detected as such and are hardly edit-able
1.2 Add shader Loading system
1.3 Stop reusing the same data on different VBO

2.0 Add actual functionality                [Partly Completed, System for handling objects and behaviour exists]
2.1 Clean up functionality
-> Collisions and Border detection are handeled seperately
-> Create Collision object for Border? Probably yes
2.2 Add unique types of objects
-> Each unique object could have a different VBO
2.3 Add Controlls

3 Clean up code
