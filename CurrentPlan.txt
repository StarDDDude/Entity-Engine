1.0 Add Graphics                    [Partly Completed]
1.1 Add Transformations             [Finished, though messy, MUST move draw function]
-> Transormations can't be easily detected as such and are hardly edit-able
1.2 Add shader Loading system
1.3 Stop reusing the same data on different VBO


2.0 Add actual functionality                [Partly Completed, System for handling objects and behaviour exists]
2.1 Clean up functionality
2.2 Add unique types of objects
-> Each different object could have a different VBO
-> Make the VBO static members of the object and let translations do the rest
2.3 Add Controlls
2.4 Generate "events" for interactions
-> Events can be subscribed to by components

Plans for how to do that:
Move all Functionality into a System
Checked: This system saves an ID for each object (something for handling their pointer), as well as what type it is
There are events, these events will be worked on by the systems that have subscribed to it
Events are generated by systems
There should be an order for working these off, or maybe not.
-> Some way to not have them stack up infinitely

Events:
An "event" calls a subroutine and saves on which data it has to be executed
Data:
-FunctionPointer
-List of objects to execute it on
